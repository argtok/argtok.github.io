      <p>Tourism in Albania is rapidly on the rise, as the country, long considered one of Europe's last hidden gems, has opened up politically and economically.

      <h2>Tourism in Albania</h2>
      <p>Albania’s beaches, such as those in Ksamil, Dhermi, and Saranda, are some of the most beautiful in the world, with their crystal-clear waters and breathtaking landscapes. However, the country also offers a very different kind of natural wonder: the Albanian Alps. These rugged mountains are a haven for hikers and adventurers looking for something off the beaten path. Places like Theth and Valbona attract visitors with their serene beauty, offering a peaceful retreat from busy city life. This duality — pristine beaches and rugged mountains — makes Albania a uniquely diverse travel destination.</p>

      <h2>Modern History</h2>
      <p>Albania spent much of the 20th century under a communist dictatorship, isolated from the rest of Europe and the world. Although this isolation set Albania back economically, it also preserved much of its cultural heritage and historical landmarks. Since the fall of communism in the early 1990s, Albania has been rapidly modernizing, with a renewed focus on tourism, education, and culture. Today, Albania is a vibrant, modern country that is proud of its past but looks towards a bright future as a welcoming destination for travelers from around the globe.</p>
