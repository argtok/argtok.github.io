      <h2>Tourism in Albania</h2>
      <p>Albania offers a wide variety of tourism experiences, catering to both adventure seekers and those looking to relax by the sea. The country’s coastline stretches along the Adriatic and Ionian seas, where beaches like Dhermi, Ksamil, and Saranda are known for their crystal-clear waters and white sands. These beach destinations have gained international fame, particularly on social media platforms, where images of their pristine shores attract travelers from across the globe. However, Albania also offers something unique for those who wish to escape the traditional beach vacation: the Albanian Alps. Located in the northern region, the Alps provide a stark contrast to the beaches, offering mountainous terrains for hiking, camping, and exploration. Theth and Valbona are two prominent destinations in the Alps, where visitors can enjoy untouched landscapes, fresh air, and traditional mountain hospitality. Together, these two vastly different types of tourism highlight Albania's diverse offerings.</p>

    <!-- Modern History Section -->
    <section id="modern-history" class="content-section">
      <h2>Modern History</h2>
      <p>Albania’s modern history is defined by its years of isolation during the communist regime of Enver Hoxha, which lasted from 1946 until 1992. During this time, Albania was cut off from much of the world, resulting in a significant lag in development compared to other European countries. While this isolation left Albania underdeveloped in terms of infrastructure, it also played a role in preserving the country's culture, traditions, and natural environment. As the rest of Europe modernized rapidly, Albania retained its historical charm, which today attracts visitors looking for authentic experiences. The country is now undergoing rapid change, with efforts focused on economic growth and modernization. Since opening its doors to the world in the early 1990s, Albania has gradually emerged as a vibrant and welcoming destination for tourists. Its people are eager to showcase their rich heritage, stunning landscapes, and hospitality to visitors from across the globe.</p>
